My attempt at a procedural blackjack game for Tealeaf Academy's 'Introduction to Ruby and Web Development'

I found this assignment reasonably staightforward because I focused on not being caught somewhere between logic and coding. 
When writing logic, I really tried not to think about coding, and vice versa.
This didn't make the assignment any eaiser, but it meant it required more patience than it did magical skills.
Feeling like I needed magical skills to solve problems like this programmatically was a problem for me previously.

Please comment on any improvements that you feel could be made!
