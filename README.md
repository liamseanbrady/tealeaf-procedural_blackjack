My attempt at a procedural blackjack game for Tealeaf Academy's 'Introduction to Ruby and Web Development'

I found this assignment reasonably staightforward because I focused on never being caught between the
two planes of logic and coding. When I was writing logic, I never thought about coding, and vice versa.
This didn't make the assignment any more easy, but it meant it required more patience than it did magical skills,
which was a problem for me previously.

Please comment on any improvements that you feel could be made!
